Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The client was The Gaming Room, they wanted to improve functionality and expand to more platforms with the software they had for their game Draw It or Lose It.

I believe I done well with explaining their choices of platforms and how they will effect their application, such as cost, finding programmers, etc.

Having the design document helped me to make sure I didn't skip anything and that I included everything I needed to. I like that it is just an advanced to-do list.

I forgot to fill in the revisions part, so it made it a little difficult to go back and see what I had and hadn't done already.

I just tried to give the client what they wanted as if they don't like your work they will not use you again.

I used the design document, took lots of notes on what ideas I had and tried to give the client what they wanted.
